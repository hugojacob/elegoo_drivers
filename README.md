# Why?
Elegoo already provides drivers and libraries to control/interact with their sensors,
however, I have observed that they can be improved quite a lot, hence, I decided to
rewrite them on my own.

Also, it's kinda fun. :)

All the drivers here were written/tested using [1]. It is very likely they will work
with different kits/manufacturers but I never tested them neither intended to do so.
